Add a new chapter to the game called **“The Graphing Grounds.”**

### Purpose
Introduce graphing concepts such as slope, y-intercept, and linear equations in the form y = mx + b.

### Narrative Context
After stabilizing the Variable Valley, ARIA detects new corruption in the *Graphing Grounds*. 
Here, lines themselves have fractured — slopes distorted, intercepts misaligned. 
The Protocol Agent must restore balance by recalibrating each “Light Path” (line) to its correct slope and intercept.

### Gameplay Requirements
1. **Randomized Graphing Problems**
   - Create a small database of at least 8 linear equation problems of the form y = mx + b.
   - Each puzzle entry should contain:
     ```python
     graph_puzzles = [
       {"question": "Find the slope of the line passing through (2, 3) and (5, 9)", 
        "answer": "2", 
        "hints": ["Use m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)", "Subtract 3 from 9, subtract 2 from 5, then divide."]},
       {"question": "What is the y-intercept of y = 3x - 4?", 
        "answer": "-4",
        "hints": ["Look for the constant term in y = mx + b."]},
       {"question": "Which equation has slope ½ and y-intercept 3?", 
        "answer": "y = 0.5x + 3",
        "hints": ["Substitute m = ½ and b = 3 into y = mx + b."]}
     ]
     ```

2. **Gameplay Flow**
   - ARIA introduces the concept of *slope* and *intercept*.
   - Randomly select an unsolved puzzle from `graph_puzzles`.
   - If player answers correctly:
     - Print a short story sequence: “The Light Path stabilizes; slope restored.”
     - Increase `mastery_graph` by 1.
   - If incorrect:
     - Display one hint from the puzzle’s list.
     - After 3 wrong attempts, reveal the answer with ARIA’s dialogue (“Let’s analyze it together…”).

3. **Progress System**
   - Track progress with `mastery_graph` (0–5).
   - After 5 correct problems, trigger a short cutscene text:
     “The Graphing Grounds shimmer in harmony. The Archive’s pathways are whole again.”

4. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Keep the same UI style (text-based, ARIA feedback).
   - Use ASCII dividers or color codes for clarity.
   - Add this chapter as `chapter_graphing()` function, called after Variable Valley completion.

5. **Educational Focus**
   - Include 3 puzzle types:
     - Calculate slope from two points.
     - Identify y-intercept from equation.
     - Write equation from slope and intercept.
   - Keep multiple attempts, adaptive hints, and narrative reinforcement.
